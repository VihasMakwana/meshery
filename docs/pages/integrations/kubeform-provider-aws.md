### Overview & Features:
1. Kubeform is a Kubernetes operator provisioning cloud or on-prem resources using Terraform providers. Kubeform provides auto-generated Kubernetes CRDs for Terraform resources so that you can manage any cloud infrastructure in a Kubernetes native way. You just write a CRD for a cloud infrastructure, apply it and Kubeform will create it for you! Kubeform currently supports 5 top cloud platforms. These are AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean and Linode.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Integration Template

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Native Kubernetes support.



6. Built on Terraform; Supports Terraform resources

7. Define & manage cloud infrastructures as Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition)

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.
