### Overview & Features:
1. AWS CloudTrail monitors and records account activity across your AWS infrastructure, giving you control over storage, analysis, and remediation actions.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for AWS CloudTrail

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Data events that capture data plane actions within a resource, such as reading or writing an Amazon S3 object.

6. Configuration items from AWS Config that capture resource configuration history and resource compliance history as evaluated by AWS Config rules.

7. Audit evidence from AWS Audit Manager that contains the information needed to demonstrate compliance with the requirements as specified by Audit Manager controls.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.
