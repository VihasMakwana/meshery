### Overview & Features:
1. Amazon MemoryDB for Redis is a durable database with microsecond reads, low single-digit millisecond writes, scalability, and enterprise security. MemoryDB delivers 99.99% availability and near instantaneous recovery without any data loss.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for AWS MemoryDB for Redis

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Amazon MemoryDB for Redis enables machine learning (ML) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to work with data stored in Amazon MemoryDB in real-time and without moving your data.

6. Amazon MemoryDB provides native support for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) documents in addition to the data structures included in open source Redis, at no additional cost.

7. MemoryDB stores your entire dataset in memory to deliver microsecond read latency, single-digit millisecond write latency, and high throughput. It can handle more than 13 trillion requests per day and support peaks of 160 million requests per second.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.
